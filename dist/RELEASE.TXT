  Introduction

This is the 0.0.2 Son House Release of Sparqlycode. This release
provides access to more basic Java concepts and provides SPARQL query
equivalents for some of the tests used in the source code analysis tool
- PMD.

We tested the processing across a large number of Apache Software
Foundation projects. Sparqlycode for those, and more projects, will be
available for purchase in future (to save you having to do it yourself).

Find in the distribution documentation for installing and operating
Sparqlycode:

doc/readme.html

examples/examples.html


It still requires prerequisite knowledge of the concepts behind the W3C
Semantic Web technologies SPARQL and RDF but instructions on how to run
a query using Jena has been included in examples/query.html.


  0.0.2 User Stories

modifiers like public, private, package etc..

Ability to process source from Subversion and Git AND Mercurial was
implemented (only available in licensed product)

Basic user interface (only available in licensed product)

Linked data exemplified. We are able to demonstrate how dependency
source code can be linked and queried easily with your own code.

Apache Foundation Java projects. Sparqlycode of popular dependencies for
open source projects can now be purchased from us or you can process
them yourself.
